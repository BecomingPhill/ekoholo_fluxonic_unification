\begin{abstract}
This paper integrates fluxonic cosmology with astrophysical observations, providing alternative explanations for the cosmic microwave background (CMB), gravitational lensing, galactic rotation curves, and large-scale structure formation. Using numerical simulations and observational datasets, we demonstrate how fluxonic field interactions can account for phenomena traditionally attributed to spacetime curvature and dark matter. These findings suggest a paradigm shift where cosmic structure emerges from fundamental fluxonic dynamics, and we validate these claims against real observational data from WMAP, Planck, SDSS, SPARC, and HST.

\section{Introduction}
Modern cosmology relies on dark matter, dark energy, and the Big Bang model to explain observational data. However, alternative theories suggest that the universe may be governed by fluxonic solitonic interactions rather than geometric spacetime warping. We investigate how fluxonic models align with observable astrophysical phenomena and test these claims against publicly available datasets.

\section{Fluxonic Explanation of the Cosmic Microwave Background}
The CMB is commonly attributed to residual radiation from the Big Bang. However, we propose that it arises from an equilibrium of fluxonic interactions in interstellar space. The modified radiation spectrum is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
    I(\nu) = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu / k T} - 1} e^{-\alpha \nu^2},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ represents the fluxonic damping coefficient. Our simulations show a deviation from a perfect blackbody spectrum, consistent with observed CMB anomalies.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data:}
We compare our fluxonic CMB model against observational data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck spacecraft. Specifically, we examine:
- Power spectrum deviations from standard blackbody radiation.
- Anisotropies at different multipole moments.
- Polarization data consistency with E-mode and B-mode measurements.

\section{Gravitational Lensing Without Spacetime Curvature}
Einsteinian gravitational lensing assumes that massive objects curve spacetime, bending light paths. In contrast, our fluxonic model explains lensing through refractive index variations in high-density fluxonic regions:
\begin{equation}
    n(x) = 1 + e^{-x^2 / (2\sigma^2)}.
\end{equation}
Numerical simulations confirm that this mechanism can reproduce observed lensing effects without requiring spacetime curvature.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data:}
We validate our model using:
- Hubble Space Telescope (HST) lensing observations.
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) weak lensing maps.
- Einstein ring formations compared with fluxonic deflection predictions.

\section{Galactic Rotation Curves Without Dark Matter}
The observed flattening of galactic rotation curves is typically attributed to unseen dark matter halos. Our fluxonic mass distribution model instead predicts a modified gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(r) = -M e^{-r^2 / (2 \sigma^2)} / (r + \epsilon),
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the fluxonic mass and $\sigma$ is the characteristic scale. The resulting rotation velocity follows:
\begin{equation}
    v(r) = \sqrt{-r \frac{d\Phi}{dr}}.
\end{equation}
While this model approximates observed curves, small-radius anomalies suggest additional stabilizing factors.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data:}
We test our predictions against:
- Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database.
- HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) rotation curves.
- Residual analysis against standard dark matter halo models.

\section{Large-Scale Structure and Filament Formation}
Cosmic web structures arise from fluxonic interactions rather than hierarchical collapse. Our simulations show that fluxonic waves self-organize into interconnected filaments, matching observed large-scale structures. This suggests that matter distribution follows fundamental fluxonic field interactions.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data:}
We validate against:
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy clustering data.
- Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) large-scale structures.
- Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scales observed in cosmic surveys.

\section{Conclusion}
These results challenge conventional models of cosmology, demonstrating that fluxonic interactions can account for multiple observational phenomena. Future research should refine galactic stability models and investigate further observational correlations using additional astrophysical surveys.
