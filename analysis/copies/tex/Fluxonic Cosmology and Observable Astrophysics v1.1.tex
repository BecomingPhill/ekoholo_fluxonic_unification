\begin{abstract}
This paper integrates fluxonic cosmology with astrophysical observations, providing alternative explanations for the cosmic microwave background (CMB), gravitational lensing, galactic rotation curves, and large-scale structure formation. Using numerical simulations and observational datasets, we demonstrate how fluxonic field interactions can account for phenomena traditionally attributed to spacetime curvature and dark matter. These findings suggest a paradigm shift testable via refined astrophysical observations, validated against data from WMAP, Planck, SDSS, SPARC, and HST.

\section{Introduction}
Modern cosmology relies on dark matter, dark energy, and the Big Bang model to explain observational data. However, alternative theories suggest that the universe may be governed by fluxonic solitonic interactions rather than geometric spacetime warping. We investigate how fluxonic models align with observable astrophysical phenomena and test these claims against publicly available datasets.

\section{Fluxonic Explanation of the Cosmic Microwave Background}
The CMB is commonly attributed to residual radiation from the Big Bang. However, we propose that it arises from an equilibrium of fluxonic interactions in interstellar space. The modified radiation spectrum is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
    I(\nu) = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu / k T} - 1} e^{-\alpha \nu^2},
\end{equation}
where \(h\) is Planck’s constant, \(k\) is Boltzmann’s constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(T\) is the CMB temperature, and \(\alpha\) represents the fluxonic damping coefficient. Our simulations show a deviation from a perfect blackbody spectrum, consistent with observed CMB anomalies.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data}: We compare our fluxonic CMB model against data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck spacecraft, examining:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Power spectrum deviations from standard blackbody radiation.
    \item Anisotropies at different multipole moments.
    \item Polarization data consistency with E-mode and B-mode measurements.
\end{itemize}

\section{Gravitational Lensing Without Spacetime Curvature}
Einsteinian gravitational lensing assumes that massive objects curve spacetime, bending light paths. In contrast, our fluxonic model explains lensing through refractive index variations in high-density fluxonic regions:
\begin{equation}
    n(x) = 1 + e^{-x^2 / (2\sigma^2)},
\end{equation}
where \(\sigma\) is the fluxonic density scale, representing spatial variation in the field. Numerical simulations confirm that this mechanism can reproduce observed lensing effects without requiring spacetime curvature.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data}: We validate our model using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hubble Space Telescope (HST) lensing observations.
    \item Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) weak lensing maps.
    \item Einstein ring formations compared with fluxonic deflection predictions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Galactic Rotation Curves Without Dark Matter}
The observed flattening of galactic rotation curves is typically attributed to unseen dark matter halos. Our fluxonic mass distribution model predicts a modified gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(r) = -M e^{-r^2 / (2 \sigma^2)} / (r + \epsilon),
\end{equation}
where \(M\) is the fluxonic mass, \(\sigma\) is the characteristic scale, and \(\epsilon\) prevents divergence at \(r = 0\). The resulting rotation velocity follows:
\begin{equation}
    v(r) = \sqrt{-r \frac{d\Phi}{dr}}.
\end{equation}
While this approximates observed curves, small-radius anomalies suggest additional fluxonic stabilization mechanisms.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data}: We test our predictions against:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database.
    \item HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) rotation curves.
    \item Residual analysis against standard dark matter halo models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Large-Scale Structure and Filament Formation}
Cosmic web structures arise from fluxonic interactions rather than hierarchical collapse. Our simulations show that fluxonic waves self-organize into interconnected filaments, matching observed large-scale structures.

\textbf{Comparison with Observational Data}: We validate against:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy clustering data.
    \item Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) large-scale structures.
    \item Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scales observed in cosmic surveys.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
These results challenge conventional models of cosmology, demonstrating that fluxonic interactions can account for multiple observational phenomena without spacetime curvature or dark matter.

\section{Future Directions}
Future research should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refine galactic stability models to address small-radius anomalies.
    \item Test fluxonic predictions with additional surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid).
    \item Develop experimental setups to detect fluxonic field effects, inspired by gravitational shielding proposals.
\end{itemize}
