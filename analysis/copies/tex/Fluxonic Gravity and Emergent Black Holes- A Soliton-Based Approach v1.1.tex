\begin{abstract}
This paper develops a fluxonic approach to gravity, demonstrating that black hole-like structures and gravitational effects emerge from self-organizing solitonic fields. We derive a fluxonic gravity equation replacing spacetime curvature with field interactions, numerically simulate soliton collapse, and confirm horizon-like structures and Hawking-like radiation. These results challenge classical black hole thermodynamics and suggest observable deviations in gravitational wave signatures, offering an alternative model for emergent gravity.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
General Relativity describes gravity as spacetime curvature, but fluxonic physics posits gravity as a collective solitonic effect. We propose a model where black holes arise from fluxonic self-organization, aligning with experimental paradigms like gravitational shielding to challenge GR.

\section{Fluxonic Gravity Equation}
We formulate gravity using a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, aligning with fluxonic principles:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \phi + m^2 \phi + g \phi^3 = 0,
\end{equation}
where \(\phi\) is the fluxonic field, \(m\) is a mass parameter, and \(g\) governs nonlinear interactions. This simplifies gravitational emergence from soliton dynamics, contrasting with spacetime curvature.

\section{Numerical Simulation of Fluxonic Black Hole Formation}
Simulations validate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emergence of stable fluxonic \textbf{black hole cores} mimicking event horizons.
    \item Retention of gravitational energy without singularities.
    \item Gradual energy emission analogous to Hawking radiation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fluxonic Hawking-Like Radiation}
Simulations show:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous energy outflow from fluxonic boundaries.
    \item Thermal radiation signature mimicking Hawking radiation.
    \item Energy dissipation without complete evaporation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications for Quantum Gravity}
The model suggests:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No Singularities:} Event horizons form without spacetime singularities.
    \item \textbf{Hawking-Like Radiation Without Quantum Fields:} Energy loss via fluxonic interactions.
    \item \textbf{Potential Dark Matter Link:} Stable fluxonic structures as dark matter candidates.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Our findings demonstrate that black hole-like structures emerge from fluxonic interactions, challenging GRâ€™s spacetime curvature paradigm.

\section{Future Directions}
Further work includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing fluxonic gravitational waves with LIGO observations.
    \item Extending to 3D simulations for realistic black hole modeling.
    \item Testing fluxonic radiation signatures experimentally.
