\begin{abstract}
This paper develops a fluxonic framework for cosmological expansion, proposing that cosmic inflation and dark energy emerge from structured fluxonic wave interactions rather than from exotic inflaton fields or a cosmological constant. We derive fluxonic field equations that reproduce early-universe exponential expansion, numerically simulate fluxonic-driven cosmic evolution, and explore implications for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and structure formation. These results suggest that cosmic expansion is driven by self-organizing fluxonic field interactions.

\section{Introduction}
Cosmology relies on the assumptions of cosmic inflation and dark energy to explain the universeâ€™s rapid early expansion and current accelerated expansion. However, the exact nature of these phenomena remains unknown. Here, we propose a fluxonic cosmological model where expansion is not caused by an inflaton field or a cosmological constant, but rather by fluxonic field interactions dynamically governing the evolution of spacetime.

\section{Fluxonic Cosmological Expansion Without a Cosmological Constant}
We propose a fluxonic alternative to the standard Friedmann equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \phi + \alpha \phi + \beta \phi^3 = 0,
\end{equation}
where \(\phi\) represents the fluxonic field, \(c\) is the wave speed, \(\alpha\) dictates expansion energy, and \(\beta\) determines nonlinear interactions that drive cosmic inflation. Unlike inflationary models requiring a separate inflaton field, fluxonic waves naturally create an expansion phase transitioning into a stable large-scale structure. The simulation simplifies \(c = 1\) for computational efficiency.

\section{Numerical Simulations of Fluxonic Inflation and Expansion}
We performed numerical simulations to analyze fluxonic cosmic evolution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early-Universe Inflationary Expansion:} Fluxonic wave interactions induce rapid, self-regulated expansion.
    \item \textbf{Dark Energy as Fluxonic Field Interactions:} Accelerated expansion results from residual fluxonic wave energy instead of a cosmological constant.
    \item \textbf{Structure Formation from Fluxonic Perturbations:} Density fluctuations in the fluxonic field align with observed CMB anisotropies, testable via Planck data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This work presents a deterministic fluxonic alternative to cosmic inflation and dark energy, suggesting that large-scale cosmic expansion results from structured fluxonic field interactions. We propose testing CMB fluctuations via precision cosmology observations to validate this model.

\section{Future Directions}
Further research will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deepening mathematical integration with cosmological datasets.
    \item Simulating 3D fluxonic evolution for structure formation.
    \item Comparing fluxonic predictions with LIGO and Planck observations.
\end{itemize}
