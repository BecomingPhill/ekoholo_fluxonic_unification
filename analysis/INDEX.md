# Analysis Project Index

Welcome to the Analysis Project for the Fluxonic Research Repository. This folder has been organized to ensure that all documentation, annotated versions of key documents, and copies of original files are separated and easily navigable. Below is an overview of the folder structure:

## Folder Structure

- **docs/**: Contains all primary documentation files (the Final Report, Roadmap, Summary, Categories, README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, etc.).

- **annotated/**: Contains annotated copies of selected documents (e.g., annotated LaTeX files) with key insights and notes for detailed analysis.

- **copies/**: Holds unmodified copies of original files from the repository, further subdivided by file type:
  - **copies/tex/**: LaTeX files
  - **copies/pdf/**: PDF files
  - **copies/py/**: Python files

## Navigation Instructions

- Begin by reviewing the **docs/README.md** for an introduction to the analysis project.
- Refer to **docs/Final_Report.md** for the synthesis of our findings and project overview.
- Check **docs/Analysis_Roadmap.md** to understand our current plan and future steps.
- Use the **annotated/** folder to view documents that have been annotated with key points for further analysis.
- Explore the **copies/** folder to access the original files (grouped by file type) on which our analysis is based.

This index is intended to serve as a guide for navigating the organized project. As the project evolves, this document will be updated to reflect new additions and changes.
