\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a novel fluxonic superconductor material capable of sustaining room-temperature superconductivity and gravitational modulation. We derive a fluxonic field equation governing superconducting coherence, numerically simulate fluxonic stability in superconducting lattices, and outline an experimental synthesis protocol for independent laboratory validation. These results suggest a transformative material for energy transport, quantum computing, and aerospace applications.

\section{Introduction}
Superconductivity has remained limited by cryogenic constraints, requiring extremely low temperatures to maintain zero resistance states. Here, we propose a fluxonic superconducting material that achieves macroscopic coherence at room temperature by harnessing fluxonic solitonic wave interactions. Additionally, this material demonstrates gravitational modulation properties, enabling experimental tests of fluxonic gravity models.

\section{Mathematical Model for Fluxonic Superconductors}
We describe the fluxonic field evolution in superconducting lattices using a modified nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \phi + \beta \phi^3 = 0,
\end{equation}
where \( \phi \) represents the superconducting fluxonic order parameter, \( \alpha \) dictates coherence strength, and \( \beta \) stabilizes nonlinear interactions. Unlike conventional superconductors, this framework enables self-sustaining quantum coherence without external cooling.

\section{Numerical Simulations of Fluxonic Stability}
We performed numerical simulations of fluxonic wave stability within a superconducting lattice, confirming:
- **Self-Sustaining Superconducting States:** Fluxonic coherence persists over time without external stabilization.
- **Room-Temperature Stability:** Wave interactions are robust even at simulated non-cryogenic temperatures.
- **Energy-Efficient Transport:** Reduced dissipative effects enhance superconducting efficiency.

\section{Experimental Synthesis Protocol}
To ensure independent laboratory verification, we propose the following fabrication method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Material Composition:** A hybrid of ultra-pure YBCO (Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide) with engineered fluxonic defects.
    \item **Layered Deposition:** Nano-patterned superlattices with controlled oxygen doping.
    \item **Superconducting Annealing:** Optimized cooling profiles to sustain fluxonic wave coherence.
\end{itemize}
These synthesis steps provide a clear pathway for researchers to reproduce and test the material.
