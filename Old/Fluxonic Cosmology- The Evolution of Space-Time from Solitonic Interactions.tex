\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the hypothesis that cosmic structure and spacetime evolution emerge from fluxonic solitonic interactions rather than a pre-existing metric. We investigate large-scale cosmic filament formation using nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations with an expansion factor. Our results suggest that cosmic expansion, structure formation, and dark energy effects may arise naturally from fluxonic dynamics, challenging traditional ΛCDM models.

\section{Introduction}
Modern cosmology relies on ΛCDM models to describe cosmic expansion and large-scale structure. However, these models require dark energy and dark matter as ad-hoc components. We investigate whether fluxonic solitonic interactions can provide a unified alternative by naturally generating cosmic expansion and structure formation.

\section{Mathematical Framework}
The governing equation for fluxonic cosmology follows the nonlinear Klein-Gordon model with an expansion term:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + m^2 \phi + g \phi^3 = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\phi(x,t)$ represents the fluxonic field, $m$ is a mass parameter, $g$ governs nonlinear interactions, and we introduce an expansion factor:
\begin{equation}
    t' = t e^{-Ht},
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the expansion rate.

\section{Numerical Simulation and Results}
A numerical simulation was performed with an initial density fluctuation, and we observed:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Filament Formation} & : \text{Stable large-scale structures emerged over time.}\\
    \text{Cosmic Expansion Effects} & : \text{Wave evolution slowed as expansion progressed.}\\
    \text{Dark Matter Equivalence} & : \text{Solitonic energy retention mimicked missing mass effects.}
\end{align*}

\section{Discussion and Implications}
1. \textbf{Dark Matter Alternative:} The solitonic structures act as gravitational sources without requiring exotic particles.
2. \textbf{Dark Energy Connection:} The emergent expansion term provides a natural mechanism for accelerating universe expansion.
3. \textbf{CMB Signatures:} Future work will compare fluxonic predictions with observed cosmic microwave background fluctuations.

\section{Conclusion}
Our findings suggest that fluxonic solitonic interactions provide a viable alternative to conventional cosmological models. Future work will investigate three-dimensional simulations and comparisons with observational data.
