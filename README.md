# ehokolo_flux: A Wave-Based Experiment

Hey all, I'm a solo tinkerer wondering: can simple waves mimic gravity, atoms, or light? This repo has my rough simulations—nothing fancy, just a laptop and some math. It's based on a wild idea called the Reciprocal System Theory (RST) by Dewey B. Larson, which says motion is the universe's core, with space and time balancing each other (x·t=k). I'm testing if waves (solitons) in this system could explain everything. It's not a new physics—it's a 'what if' to play with. I've run tests and got some cool pictures, but I need your help to spot mistakes or test it more.

### What's in Here
- **Docs**: Papers I wrote with sims, math, and results (1D, 2D, 3D), rooted in RST.
- **Code**: Python scripts to run the waves yourself (in a virtual env on my MacBook).
- **Plots**: Pictures of what I found—wave shapes, atom-like patterns, gravity ripples.

### What I've Done So Far
I've run four main sims:
- **1D Soliton**: A stable wave that moves a bit, like a particle or gravity ripple. [See: plots/soliton_plot.png]
- **2D Gravity**: Spinning rings that look like black holes or cosmic waves. [See: plots/gravity_2d_plot.png]
- **2D Matter**: Ring patterns that mimic atoms, holding shape like tiny orbits. [See: plots/matter_2d_plot.png]
- **3D All-in-One**: Waves, black hole cores, atom shapes, and even a weird idea of blocking waves (shielding)—all in 3D. [See: plots/collapse_plot.png, wave_plot.png, shielding_plot.png, atomic_plot.png]

These are just on my laptop, no lab tests yet, but they hold together and look promising, inspired by RST's motion idea.

### Why Share This
I'm not saying I've solved everything—just testing an idea from RST. I've got no pro tools or physicist friends, so I need your feedback to make it better. Is this nonsense? Cool? Missing something?

### What I Need
- **Feedback**: Run the code, read the docs—does it make sense? Where's it weak?
- **Ideas**: Cheap ways to check this (e.g., water waves, public data)?
- **Patience**: I'm DIY, not a physicist—this is messy but fun.

### How to Use
- Read the papers, each has equations and code simple code examples that can be used to run the simulations yourself. You can extend the simulations to more dimensions or add more complex features.
- Activate my virtual env: `source fluxenv/bin/activate` (create with `python3 -m venv fluxenv` if needed).
- Install libs: `pip install numpy matplotlib`.
- Run scripts: `python fluxonic_3d.py`, `python soliton_dynamics.py`, etc.
- Check plots in `plots/`.
